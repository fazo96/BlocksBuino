# BlocksBuino Reloaded

This is a work in progress fork of the original __BlocksBuino__ game for
gamebuino that you can find [here](https://github.com/frthery/BlocksBuino).

## Additional features

- Improved code a little bit! Will improve and comment more in the future
- You can press UP to make the current block fall instantly
- You can now navigate to the title screen to restart the game

## Upcoming features

- Saving, loading, high scores (this will be hard and I'll probably never do it)
- Press B to pause!
- Open the menu with C to change difficulty and restart the game
- Music! (if there is enough space and someone sends me the track!)
